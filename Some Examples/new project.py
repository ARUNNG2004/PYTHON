1. If the volume of a cube of side length x is v = x 3 . Find the
rate of change of the volume with respect to x when x = 5 units.
2. Find the slope of the tangent to the curve at the respective given
points. y = x 4 + 2x 2 − x at x =1

4. A stone is dropped into a pond causing ripples in the form of
concentric circles. The radius r of the outer ripple is increasing at a
constant rate at 2 cm per second. When the radius is 5 cm find the
rate of changing of the total area of the disturbed water?
5. Evaluate
6. An egg of a particular bird is very nearly spherical. If the radius
to the inside of the shell is 5 mm and radius to the outside of the
shell is 5.3 mm, find the volume of the shell approximately.
7. Find df for f (x) = x + 3x and evaluate it for x = 3 and dx = 0.02

law s(t) = − t 2 + 3. At what time the velocity and acceleration
are zero respectively?
12. For what value of x the tangent of the curve y = x 3 − 3x 2 + x − 2

14. Find two positive numbers whose product is 20 and their sum is
minimum.

approximate change in the area and the approximate percentage
change in the area.
19. A sphere is made of ice having radius 10 cm. Its radius
decreases from 10 cm to 9 8 . cm. Find approximations for the
following:
(i) change in the volume
(ii) change in the surface area
20. A coat of paint of thickness 0 2 . cm is applied to the faces of a
cube whose edge is 10 cm. Use the differentials to find
approximately how many cubic centimetres of paint is used to paint
this cube. Also calculate the exact amount of paint used to paint
this cube.PART-C

21. Salt is poured from a conveyer belt at a rate of 30 cubic
meters per minute forming a conical pile with a circular base whose
height and diameter of base are always equal. How fast is the height
of the pile increasing when the pile is 10 metre high?
22. A police jeep, approaching an orthogonal intersection from the
northern direction, is chasing a speeding car that has turned and
moving straight east. When the jeep is 0.6 km north of the
intersection and the car is 0.8 km to the east. The police determine
with a radar that the distance between them and the car is increasing
at 20 km/hr. If the jeep is moving at 60 km/hr at the instant of
measurement, what is the speed of the car?
23. Find the equations of the tangents to the curve y = 1 + x 3 for
which the tangent is orthogonal with the line x + 12y = 12.
24. Find the equation of the tangent and normal to the
Lissajous curve given by x = 2 cos 3t and y = 3 sin 2t, t ∈ R.
25. For the function f(x) = 4x 3 + 3x 2 − 6x + 1 find the intervals of
monotonicity, local extrema, intervals of concavity and points of
inflection
26. Discuss the monotonicity and local extrema of the function
f(x) = og(1 + x) −

og(1 + x) >
.
27. Find the local maximum and minimum of the function x 2 y 2 on
the line x + y = 10
28. We have a 12 square unit piece of thin material and want to
make an open box by cutting small squares from the corners of our
material and folding the sides up. The question is, which cut
produces the box of maximum volume?29. (i) The radius of a circular plate is measured as 12.65 cm instead
of the actual length 12.5 cm. find the following in calculating the
area of the circular plate:
(a) Absolute error
(b) Relative error
(c) Percentage error
(ii) Show that the percentage error in the n th root of a number is
Approximately times the percentage error in the number.
